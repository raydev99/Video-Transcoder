# Video Transcoder with Video Processing

This project is a **Video Transcoder** that allows users to **upload videos**, **transcode them**, and **watch the processed videos** through a Next.js web application. It leverages several cloud services to handle video uploads, processing, and metadata management.

**Note:** This public demo is under strict moderation to avoid illegal content such as inappropriate videos.

### Available Features

- 🔍 **List Videos**: Browse all uploaded videos.
- 🎥 **Watch Videos**: Watch both uploaded and transcoded videos.
- 👤 **Sign In/Out**: Secure authentication via Firebase Auth.
- ⬆️ **Upload Videos**: Upload your videos for processing.
- 🛠️ **Transcoded Videos**: Watch transcoded videos after upload.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Cloud Storage**: Stores raw and processed videos uploaded by users.
2. **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: Handles messaging between the video upload and processing services.
3. **Cloud Run (Video Processing Service)**: A private service that transcodes uploaded videos using FFmpeg and then uploads the processed videos back to Cloud Storage.
4. **Cloud Firestore**: Stores video metadata (e.g., video titles, descriptions, status).
5. **Cloud Run (Next.js Web App)**: Hosts the YouTube clone web client.
6. **Firebase Functions**: Acts as the backend API, fetching and returning video metadata stored in Firestore to the web client.
